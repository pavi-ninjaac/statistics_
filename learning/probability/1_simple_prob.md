1. 7) Anita randomly picks 4 cards from a deck of 52-cards and places them back into the deck ( Any set of 4 cards is equally likely ). Then, Babita randomly chooses 8 cards out of the same deck ( Any set of 8 cards is equally likely). Assume that the choice of 4 cards by Anita and the choice of 8 cards by Babita are independent. What is the probability that all 4 cards chosen by Anita are in the set of 8 cards chosen by Babita?

A)48C4 x 52C4

B)48C4 x 52C8

C)48C8 x 52C8

D) None of the above

Solution: (A)

The total number of possible combination would be 52C4 (For selecting 4 cards by Anita) * 52C8 (For selecting 8 cards by Babita).

Since, the 4 cards that Anita chooses is among the 8 cards which Babita has chosen, thus the number of combinations possible is 52C4 (For selecting the 4 cards selected by Anita) * 48C4 (For selecting any other 4 cards by Babita, since the 4 cards selected by Anita are common)


2. 10) A group of 60 students is randomly split into 3 classes of equal size. All partitions are equally likely. Jack and Jill are two students belonging to that group. What is the probability that Jack and Jill will end up in the same class?

A) 1/3

B) 19/59

C) 18/58

D) 1/2

Solution: (B)

Assign a different number to each student from 1 to 60. Numbers 1 to 20 go in group 1, 21 to 40 go to group 2, 41 to 60 go to group 3.

All possible partitions are obtained with equal probability by a random assignment if these numbers, it doesn’t matter with which students we start, so we are free to start by assigning a random number to Jack and then we assign a random number to Jill. After Jack has been assigned a random number there are 59 random numbers available for Jill and 19 of these will put her in the same group as Jack. Therefore the probability is 19/59


3. 11) We have two coins, A and B. For each toss of coin A, the probability of getting head is 1/2 and for each toss of coin B, the probability of getting Heads is 1/3. All tosses of the same coin are independent. We select a coin at random and toss it till we get a head. The probability of selecting coin A is ¼ and coin B is 3/4. What is the expected number of tosses to get the first heads?

A) 2.75

B) 3.35

C) 4.13

D) 5.33



Solution: (A)

If coin A is selected then the number of times the coin would be tossed for a guaranteed Heads is 2, similarly, for coin B it is 3. Thus the number of times would be

Tosses = 2 * (1/4)[probability of selecting coin A] + 3*(3/4)[probability of selecting coin B]

             = 2.75


4. 17) A roulette wheel has 38 slots – 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green. You play five games and always bet on red slots. How many games can you expect to win?

A) 1.1165

B) 2.3684

C) 2.6316

C) 2.6316

D) 4.7368
Solution: (B)

The probability that it would be Red in any spin is 18/38. Now, you are playing the game 5 times and all the games are independent of each other. Thus, the number of games that you can win would be 5*(18/38) = 2.3684
